🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a powerful HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI for visualization and Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. The dashboard is designed to give HR professionals and business stakeholders a clear, data-driven overview of the workforce's health and key performance indicators (KPIs) through interactive visualizations.

Key areas covered include:

Employee Attrition Analysis: Identifying high-risk groups by department, job role, and over time.

Performance and Job Satisfaction: Analyzing the relationship between performance ratings, job satisfaction, and employee tenure.

Workforce Demographics: Distribution analysis by gender, marital status, and job level.

Compensation and Tenure Insights: Correlating tenure, job level, and monthly income trends.

The dashboard provides both high-level summaries and in-depth analysis, enabling strategic decisions to improve employee experience, retention, and overall workforce productivity.

🚀 Key Insights & Features
✅ Clean, professional layout: Designed following best practices in Power BI to ensure clarity and user engagement. ✅ Dynamic Attrition Visuals: Bar charts to visualize Attrition Rate by Department (e.g., Sales, Human Resources) and Attrition Rate by Job Role (e.g., Sales Representative, Laboratory Technician). ✅ Performance and Satisfaction Correlation: Visualization of Average Job Satisfaction by Performance Rating and Job Satisfaction by Tenure Group. ✅ Interactive Slicers and Filters: Analyze data by Department, Job Role, and Gender for granular insights. ✅ Key Metrics Tracked: * Total Employees (e.g., 1.47K) * Attrition Rate (%) (e.g., 16.1%) * Avg. Monthly Income * Avg. Tenure (Years) * Job Satisfaction (%) ✅ Custom DAX Measures for: * Calculating Attrition Rate percentages across different segments. * Creating Tenure Groupings for trend analysis. * Analyzing Monthly Income Distribution by Job Role. ✅ Uses SQL for efficient data extraction and initial transformation. ✅ Jupyter Notebook for detailed data wrangling, cleaning, and feature engineering (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing columns).
